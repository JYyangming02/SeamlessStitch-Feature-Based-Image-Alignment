# SeamlessStitch:Feature Based Image Alignment

## Introduction

SeamlessStitch is an image stitching pipeline that leverages feature-based matching techniques to align and blend multiple images into a seamless panorama.  
The project implements SIFT feature extraction, KNN matching with Loweâ€™s ratio test, RANSAC for robust homography estimation, and multiple blending methods for smooth image fusion.


## Stitching Example (Demo)


<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">

  <div style="text-align: center; margin-right: 20px;">
    <img src="datasets/image_stitching_challenge/challenge_12.jpg" width="300"/>
    <p>Base1.jpg</p>
  </div>

  <div style="text-align: center; margin-right: 20px;">
    <img src="datasets/Challenge/Challenge3.jpg" width="250"/>
    <p>Base2.jpg</p>
  </div>

  <div style="font-size: 40px; align-self: center;">

  <div style="text-align: center; margin-left: 20px;">

## Features

- **SIFT Feature Detection**: Extract scale and rotation-invariant features.
- **KNN Matching with Lowe's Ratio Test**: Robust feature matching to filter outliers.
- **Homography Estimation with RANSAC**: Estimate transformation matrix even with noisy matches.
- **Image Blending**:
  - Linear alpha blending
  - Single (Affine-transformed) blending
- **Support for sequential multi-image stitching** (extendable)
- **Modular Code Structure** for easy maintenance and expansion.

## Usage
```
python src/main.py
```
The script will:

- Read two images from datasets/

- Perform feature matching and homography estimation

- Stitch the images together

You can modify src/main.py to stitch your own images by changing the image paths.

## ðŸš§ Known Issues and Future Improvements

- **Single Blending Limitation**:  
  The `single_blending` method currently cannot produce effective stitching results under all scenarios. Improvements to the warping and alignment process are needed to enhance robustness.

- **Color Difference Across Regions**:  
  Although basic gain compensation `(blending-create_mask)` has been applied to mitigate brightness and color inconsistencies between stitched regions, the current method offers only limited improvement. Significant color differences may still be visible in the final output.
