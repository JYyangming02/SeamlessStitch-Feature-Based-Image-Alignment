# SeamlessStitch-Feature-Based-Image-Alignment
This project implements a robust image stitching pipeline using feature-based matching techniques. It includes key steps such as SIFT feature detection, KNN matching with Loweâ€™s ratio test, RANSAC-based homography estimation, and multi-method blending (linear blending and single blending) to produce seamless panoramic images.
